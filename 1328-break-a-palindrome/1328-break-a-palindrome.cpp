Approach 1 : Brute Force 

Algorithm : Convert every character of a string between 'a' to 'z' And then check whether it is a palindrome or not , if it is a
palindrome , then we can't do anything . Else , if it is not a 
palindrome , as of now our first criteria gets matched , its the 
time to figure out the lexicographically smallest one out of all
possibilities.

T.C : O(N*26)
S.C : O(N) --> for the string that we gonna return

Approach 2 : Greedy + Observation

Algorithm : Now we need to think us a greedy person :)

See , in the question they ask to find out the lexicographically smallest string . If there is no such constraints (it must not be a palindrome , exactly one move is given to us , etc.) , in that scenario , we will fill all the n charcters as "aaaa...aaa" (n times) . 

Now start adding constraints , we are bound to use the move exactly one times. So , what if we are in search of the character which is not equal to 'a' from the left of the string , and convert it into 'a'. e.g: "aabccbaa" , 'b' is the first character which is not equal to 'a' , in order to achieve lex smallest string we will change that . "aabccbaa" --> "aaaccbaa"

Hmmmm , as of now we are left with only one constraint , that is the resultant string must not be a palindrome . Wait , initially a string is given to us where s[i] = s[n-i-1] (0 <= i <= n/2).
If we change the first non 'a' character with 'a' , that means s[i]='a' and s[n-i-1]!='a' , which clearly implies that it is no longer a palindrome.

But , what we will do for the strings like "aaaaaa" , "aaaaa" . We can't convert any non 'a' character , we will change the last character of the string as 'b' [second smallest character after 'a']. e.g - "aaaaaa" --> "aaaaab".

T.C : O(N)
S.C : O(N)
